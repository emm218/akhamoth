# Akhamoth

My attempt at making a type checked language for the BEAM. I like gleam but was
missing type classes and metaprogramming from elixir.

`akhamoth` is a library crate containing the compiler internals, `akhc` is
a binary crate to actually compile individual source files. In the future I plan
to add a language server and a project build tool as well.
